			<p class="italic">The area of cells in the brain that detect different smells is around 40 times larger in dogs than humans. This means that your dog can pick up on way more smells than we ever could. This is why dogs are often used to sniff out people, drugs and even money!</p>

			<p>Dogs are domesticated descendants of wolves. 
				They are derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, 
				and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. 
				Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 
				15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture. Due to their long 
				association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic 
				individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would 
				be inadequate for other canids.</p>
